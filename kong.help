Here's a comprehensive manual test script you can use:
bash#!/bin/bash

KONG_ADMIN="http://kong-admin:8001"
KONG_PROXY="http://kong-gateway:8000"

echo "=== Kong Control Plane Health Checks ==="

echo "1. Kong Status:"
curl -s $KONG_ADMIN/status | jq .

echo -e "\n2. Clustering Status:"
curl -s $KONG_ADMIN/clustering/status | jq .

echo -e "\n3. Routes Count:"
curl -s $KONG_ADMIN/routes | jq '.data | length'

echo -e "\n4. Services Count:"
curl -s $KONG_ADMIN/services | jq '.data | length'

echo -e "\n5. Active Plugins:"
curl -s $KONG_ADMIN/plugins | jq '.data[].name'

echo -e "\n6. Test Route (replace with your actual route):"
curl -i $KONG_PROXY/api/health

echo -e "\n=== Upstream Health ==="
# Get all upstreams and check their health
curl -s $KONG_ADMIN/upstreams | jq -r '.data[].name' | while read upstream; do
    echo "Upstream: $upstream"
    curl -s $KONG_ADMIN/upstreams/$upstream/health | jq .
done
Quick Route Validation Commands
11. Validate Route Configuration
bash# Test if route matches expected path
curl -v http://kong-gateway:8000/your-route-path

# Test with different HTTP methods
curl -X POST http://kong-gateway:8000/your-route-path
curl -X PUT http://kong-gateway:8000/your-route-path
curl -X DELETE http://kong-gateway:8000/your-route-path
12. Debug Route Issues
bash# Check route with verbose output
curl -v -H "Host: your-service.com" http://kong-gateway:8000/

# Test with Kong debug headers (if debug plugin enabled)
curl -H "Kong-Debug: 1" http://kong-gateway:8000/your-route
Environment-Specific URLs
Replace these with your actual Kong deployment details:

Admin API: Usually port 8001
Proxy: Usually port 8000 or 80/443
Manager (Enterprise): Usually port 8002
Developer Portal (Enterprise): Usually port 8003
Status/Metrics: Usually port 8100

Common Response Codes to Expect

200: Success
404: Route/service not found
502: Upstream service unavailable
503: Kong service unavailable
401/403: Authentication/authorization issues

Would you like me to help you create specific health check commands for your particular Kong setup or routes?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Vwhat's kong admin url as I have control plane in SAASEditIn a Kong hybrid deployment where your control plane is in SaaS (Kong Konnect), you don't have direct access to a local Kong Admin API URL like you would in a self-hosted setup.
Kong Konnect SaaS Control Plane Access
1. Kong Konnect Cloud Admin Interface
https://cloud.konghq.com/

This is your web-based control plane interface
Manage routes, services, plugins through the GUI
No direct API access to admin endpoints

2. Kong Konnect API (if available)
https://us.api.konghq.com/v2/  # US region
https://eu.api.konghq.com/v2/  # EU region
Example API calls to Konnect:
bash# List services (requires Konnect API token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KONNECT_TOKEN" \
  https://us.api.konghq.com/v2/control-planes/{cp-id}/core-entities/services

# List routes
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KONNECT_TOKEN" \
  https://us.api.konghq.com/v2/control-planes/{cp-id}/core-entities/routes
Data Plane Monitoring URLs (In Your EKS)
Since you can't access the control plane admin API directly, focus on data plane monitoring:
1. Kong Data Plane Status Endpoint
bash# Check data plane status (this runs in your EKS)
curl -i http://kong-dp-pod:8100/status

# Or via kubectl port-forward
kubectl port-forward svc/kong-dp-admin 8001:8001 -n kong
curl -i http://localhost:8001/status
2. Data Plane Clustering Status
bash# Check connection to SaaS control plane
curl -i http://kong-dp-pod:8100/clustering/status

# Via port-forward
kubectl port-forward svc/kong-dp-admin 8001:8001 -n kong
curl -i http://localhost:8001/clustering/status
3. Data Plane Configuration Status
bash# Check if config is synced from control plane
curl -i http://kong-dp-pod:8100/config

# Check data plane cluster info
curl -i http://kong-dp-pod:8100/clustering/data-planes
Manual Route Testing (Data Plane)
4. Test Routes Through Data Plane Proxy
bash# Test your actual routes (this goes through data plane in EKS)
curl -i http://kong-proxy:8000/your-api-path

# With custom headers
curl -i -H "Host: api.example.com" http://kong-proxy:8000/

# Test with authentication
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer token" http://kong-proxy:8000/protected
5. Health Check Your Services
bash# Test service endpoints through Kong proxy
curl -i http://kong-proxy:8000/api/v1/health
curl -i http://kong-proxy:8000/api/v1/status
Getting Your Kong Data Plane Admin URL
If you deployed Kong data plane in EKS, you can access it via:
Option 1: Port Forward
bash# Forward data plane admin port
kubectl port-forward svc/kong-dp-admin 8001:8001 -n kong-dp

# Then access locally
curl -i http://localhost:8001/status
Option 2: Service/Ingress (if exposed)
bash# If you have an ingress/service for admin API
curl -i http://kong-dp-admin.your-domain.com/status
Option 3: Internal Cluster Access
bash# From within the cluster
curl -i http://kong-dp-admin.kong-dp.svc.cluster.local:8001/status
Key Limitations with SaaS Control Plane
❌ You CANNOT access:

http://kong-admin:8001/routes (control plane manages this)
http://kong-admin:8001/services (control plane manages this)
http://kong-admin:8001/plugins (control plane manages this)

✅ You CAN access:

Data plane status endpoints
Proxy endpoints for testing routes
Clustering/sync status
Metrics endpoints (if enabled)

Recommended Monitoring Approach
Since your control plane is SaaS, focus on:

Kong Konnect Dashboard - For configuration monitoring
Data Plane Status APIs - For runtime health
Proxy Testing - For route functionality
External Monitoring - Dynatrace, Prometheus, etc.

Sample Data Plane Health Check Script
bash#!/bin/bash

# Assuming you have port-forward or internal access
KONG_DP_ADMIN="http://localhost:8001"  # via port-forward
KONG_PROXY="http://kong-proxy:8000"    # your proxy service

echo "=== Kong Data Plane Health ==="

echo "1. Data Plane Status:"
curl -s $KONG_DP_ADMIN/status | jq .

echo -e "\n2. Control Plane Connection:"
curl -s $KONG_DP_ADMIN/clustering/status | jq .

echo -e "\n3. Test Route (replace with actual route):"
curl -i $KONG_PROXY/api/health

echo -e "\n4. Metrics (if enabled):"
curl -s http://kong-proxy:8100/metrics | head -20
Would you like me to help you set up specific monitoring for your Kong data plane in EKS, or show you how to configure the data plane admin access?
