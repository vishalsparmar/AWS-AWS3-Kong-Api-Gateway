Option 1: Direct Scaling (Simpler)
Your JMS app directly connects to mainframe and scales horizontally
Pros:

Simpler architecture
Lower latency
Fewer moving parts
Direct backpressure from mainframe

Cons:

Limited by mainframe connection limits
Harder to implement complex routing
Mainframe becomes single point of failure


***********************************************
Option 2: Local EKS Queue Manager (Recommended for High Scale)
Push to local EKS MQ → Multiple pods process
Pros:

Better decoupling
Higher scalability potential
Local queue buffering
Better fault tolerance
Complex message routing possible

Cons:

More complex setup
Additional infrastructure
Slight latency overhead

Architecture:
Mainframe MQ → EKS MQ (IBM MQ Container) → Multiple Processing Pods


**************************************************************

Why EKS Local QMgr is Best:
1. Scalability Benefits:

Unlimited pod scaling - Not constrained by mainframe connection limits
Queue-based autoscaling - Pods scale based on actual message backlog
Independent scaling - Processing capacity scales without affecting mainframe

2. Fault Tolerance:

Message buffering - Local queue acts as shock absorber for traffic spikes
Mainframe isolation - If mainframe goes down, messages already in local queue keep processing
Processing resilience - If processing pods fail, messages remain in queue

3. Performance Optimization:

Reduced mainframe load - Only bridge pod connects to mainframe
Parallel processing - Multiple pods consume simultaneously from local queue
Better throughput - Local network latency vs mainframe network calls

4. Operational Benefits:

Better monitoring - Clear visibility into queue depth and processing rates
Easier debugging - Messages persist locally for troubleshooting
Flexible routing - Can implement complex message routing/filtering locally
