What Queue Manager‚Äìto‚ÄìQueue Manager needs
You will run an MQ queue manager in EKS (containerized IBM MQ). That QMgr and the mainframe QMgr will communicate over Sender/Receiver channels.
This requires a few pieces:


**********************From the mainframe MQ admin, ask for:******************
Their QMgr name (you have this already üëç).
A Receiver channel definition on their side, e.g.:
DEFINE CHANNEL(TO.EKSQMGR) CHLTYPE(RCVR) TRPTYPE(TCP)
They will need your EKS QMgr name and the channel name you want to use.
Which IP + Port they expect your EKS QMgr to connect to (probably still port 1414, but confirm).
TLS requirements:
CipherSpec (e.g., TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256)
Exchange of certificates if TLS is enforced.
Any security rules (CHLAUTH, CONNAUTH, RACF groups) that may restrict which partner QMgrs can connect.
Which queues you‚Äôll target:
Typically, you‚Äôll need a Remote Queue definition on your EKS QMgr that points to the mainframe queue, and they‚Äôll need a corresponding XMITQ + local queue setup.


***********************On your EKS QMgr side, you‚Äôll define:*************************
Sender channel:
DEFINE CHANNEL(TO.MFQMGR) CHLTYPE(SDR) TRPTYPE(TCP) CONNAME('MF.IP.ADDR(1414)') XMITQ(MFQMGR.XMITQ)
Transmission queue:
DEFINE QLOCAL(MFQMGR.XMITQ) USAGE(XMITQ)
Remote queue (to send to their target queue):
DEFINE QREMOTE(MF.TARGET.Q) RNAME('TARGET.QUEUE') RQMNAME('MFQMGR') XMITQ(MFQMGR.XMITQ)
This way, apps in EKS just put messages to MF.TARGET.Q (remote definition) on your local QMgr, and MQ takes care of delivery to the mainframe.

‚úÖ Checklist to send to MQ Mainframe Team
You should ask them:
Receiver channel details
Please define a RCVR channel on your QMgr for my EKS QMgr.
What should we use as the channel name? (e.g., TO.EKSQMGR)
IP/Port
Confirm the IP and port I should point my SDR channel at.
TLS/security
Is TLS required? If yes, which CipherSpec?
Should we exchange certificates?
Any RACF/CHLAUTH rules to be aware of?
Queues
Which queues will I be sending to?
Do I also need to receive messages (so you define XMITQ + SDR back to me)?
Your QMgr name
(Confirm it matches what you already have ‚Äî needed for RQMNAME).





*****************Mainfrmae side *****************************

MQ-to-MQ Bridge (Two-Way)
On Mainframe QMgr (MFQMGR)
Receiver channel (to accept from EKS):
DEFINE CHANNEL(TO.MFQMGR) CHLTYPE(RCVR) TRPTYPE(TCP)
Sender channel (to send to EKS):
DEFINE CHANNEL(TO.EKSQMGR) CHLTYPE(SDR) TRPTYPE(TCP) CONNAME('eks.ip.addr(1414)') XMITQ(EKSQMGR.XMITQ)
Transmission queue for sending:
DEFINE QLOCAL(EKSQMGR.XMITQ) USAGE(XMITQ)



*****************EKS SIDE ************************

On EKS QMgr (EKSQMGR)
Receiver channel (to accept from Mainframe):
DEFINE CHANNEL(TO.EKSQMGR) CHLTYPE(RCVR) TRPTYPE(TCP)
Sender channel (to send to Mainframe):
DEFINE CHANNEL(TO.MFQMGR) CHLTYPE(SDR) TRPTYPE(TCP) CONNAME('mf.ip.addr(1414)') XMITQ(MFQMGR.XMITQ)
Transmission queue:
DEFINE QLOCAL(MFQMGR.XMITQ) USAGE(XMITQ)
Remote queues pointing to target queues on MFQMGR:
DEFINE QREMOTE(MF.TARGET.Q) RNAME('ACTUAL.MF.QUEUE') RQMNAME('MFQMGR') XMITQ(MFQMGR.XMITQ)
Local queues for Mainframe to target on EKS:
DEFINE QLOCAL(EKS.TARGET.Q)

‚úÖ Checklist to Ask MQ Mainframe Team
Here‚Äôs what you should request from them:
Channel setup
Define a Receiver (TO.MFQMGR) for my Sender.
Define a Sender (TO.EKSQMGR) pointing to my QMgr.
Connection details
Which IP + port do I use for MFQMGR?
Can they connect outbound to my EKS QMgr IP/port?
Security
Is TLS required? If so:
Which CipherSpec?
Do we need to exchange certificates?
Any CHLAUTH/RACF restrictions to allow my QMgr?
Queue mappings
Which queues on MFQMGR should I target?
Which queues on my side will they send to?
QMgr details
Confirm MF QMgr name (for RQMNAME).
