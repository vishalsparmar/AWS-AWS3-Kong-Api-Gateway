Here's what you need on each side:
On EKS MQ Queue Manager:
Channels:

Sender Channel - to send messages to mainframe
Receiver Channel - to receive messages from mainframe

Queues:

Transmission Queue - for outbound messages to mainframe (typically named after the remote queue manager)
Local queues - for receiving messages from mainframe
Remote queue definitions - pointing to queues on the mainframe

On Mainframe Queue Manager:
Channels:

Receiver Channel - to receive messages from EKS (matching the sender channel name from EKS)
Sender Channel - to send messages to EKS (matching the receiver channel name on EKS)

Queues:

Transmission Queue - for outbound messages to EKS
Local queues - for receiving messages from EKS
Remote queue definitions - pointing to queues on EKS

Key Configuration Points:

Channel Names: Sender channel name on one side must match receiver channel name on the other side
Connection Details: Configure proper hostname/IP and port for the EKS MQ service
Transmission Queue Naming: Usually named after the remote queue manager name
Network Connectivity: Ensure firewall rules allow MQ traffic (typically port 1414) between EKS cluster and mainframe
Security: Configure SSL/TLS if required, along with proper authentication

Example Channel Pair:

EKS → Mainframe: Sender channel "TO.MAINFRAME.QM"
Mainframe → EKS: Receiver channel "TO.MAINFRAME.QM"
Mainframe → EKS: Sender channel "TO.EKS.QM"
EKS → Mainframe: Receiver channel "TO.EKS.QM"

Would you like me to provide specific MQSC commands for creating these objects?RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
